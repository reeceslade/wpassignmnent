This is my web programming assignment for Bournemouth University 2022. In this assignment I had to create an online music store where user could register, login/out, change password and view/purchase goods. This website also has CRUD functionality to the admin user with correct permissions which allows this admin to create, read update and delete products or users on this site. All of this mentioned data is stored on a sql server.
